# hyperv-toggle
Powershell script to toggle Hyper-V functionality.

I needed to use WSL 2 and a Debian VM in Oracle VirtualBox. If Hyper-V is on you can start WSL, but Debian will Kernel panic.
So I wrote this simple script too switch between the WSL and VirtualBox virtualization. 

To run it call it from a Powershell terminal with admin rights.
